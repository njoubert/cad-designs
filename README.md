The "profile" is the height of layers.

## PLA

## ABS

Warping and difficulty to stick is the biggest issue.
Parts tend to shrink when cooling so dimensional accuracy is a challenge.

Getthe extruder height correct for the first layer is important and tricky. 

This whole endeavour seems pretty painful and the benefit is unclear. Let's abandon.

Simplify3D:
* Bed of 95-110 celcius (enclosure recommended)
* Glass bed plus Kapton tape or ABS slurry bed, plus adhesive (hairspray) 
* Extruder of 220-250C
* Ventilation matters, fumes come off.

## Notes

I want to make a holder for the garage door opener with a RAM ball on the bottom
I need to learn how to create a box with specific sidewall widths but overall dimensions constrained to the object I'm modeling.

* How to extrude one object from another?
* How to constrain dimensions between sketches with a excel-like formula?

I'm having some dimensional accuracy issues, not so sure why. Trent's recommendations:
* nozzle diameter might be wrong in SW
* slicing might be wrong, although surprising
* printer might be driving too fast
* crappy printer with slop in bearings, etc
* could be over-extrusion
